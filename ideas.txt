Possible Ideas to Implement, a suggetion/wishlist

- XP bonus for completed dungeons.

- Game difficulty scales with number of players. Possible approaches: As more players join, dungeon difficulty increases faster, or less bonus xp is awarded at dungeon completion. Probably a little of both would be good. Effect should be subtle, and might only be applied with 4 or more players.

- Round time limit with 2 or more players. e.g., 60 sec per round.

- Random events. E.g., "A renowned swordsman journys through town, offering to teach some techniques to those interested in training with him today." (!train command yields double xp for a day.)

- !explore command dependent on Lore skill. Higher Lore finds larger dungeons.

- Add opening message at beginning of game to outline plot: E.g., "A prophecy of a cosmic conjunction foretells doom from the underworld in thirty days hence. Can mysteries be uncovered to avert the danger?"

- List uncleared dungeons and all hero stats at the end of each round.

- After Game Over, list all dungeons and hero stats, then automatically reload.

- Don't allow the same Uncommon or Rare special event to occur two games in a row. (Counting reinforcements to a specific dungeon as one event. E.g., the Vampire Queen might summon reinforcements in one game, and the Undead Warlord might create more zomebies in the next. Same with restocking/reseting a specific dungeon.)
